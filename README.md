## Twitch TV Streamers

This is a project created for the FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Certification. Project requirements found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api).

Through this project I gained an initial understanding of Material Design and the [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) set of React components. It's nice!
